# Pizza Dough #

This is a cold/passive rise recipe, so it's gonna take a bit to get all of its fermemnty goodness going. 1/4 of the resulting dough should be good for a single 8 to 12 inch pizza (depending on desired thickness). The dough balls keep pretty well in the fridge for a week or so, but should probably be used (or perhaps frozen, not sure) within a few days.

## Ingredients ##

* 4 cups bread flour
* 3 tsp kosher salt
* 1 package instant yeast
* 1.5 cup water

## Preparation ##

1. Combine dry ingredients in a stand mixer bowl.
2. Add water.
3. Using the dough hook, mix on low-to-medium until there are no dry bits remaining.
4. Move the dough to a clean bowl, cover with plastic wrap and/or clean-but-damp kitchen towel.
5. Leave it alone for 18-48 hours, at least until it doubles in size. Go do your taxes or something.
6. When you've decided that you've damn well waited long enough, remove it from the bowl to a cutting board.
7. Divide the dough into four equally-sized pieces, wrap individually in plastic wrap.
