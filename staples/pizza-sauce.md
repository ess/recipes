# Pizza Sauce #

The amounts for spices here are listed, basically, as the bare minimum you'll want to use. They should all be reconsidered for taste. Something else that is going to be a matter of taste is the amount of time that the sauce is cooked as well as the method by which the mixture is smoothed out. I use a potato masher myself, but you're also welcome to use an immersion blender, a traditional blender, a baseball bat, et cetera.

## Ingredients ##

* 32 oz San Marzano tomatos in puree
* 2 Tbsp olive oil
* 1 Tbsp dried oregano
* 1/2 Tbsp dried basil
* 2 tsp garlic powder
* 2 tsp dried red pepper
* 2 tsp kosher salt

## Preparation ##

1. Combine everything into a smallish pot.
2. Bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce heat to low.
3. Mash the mixture with a potato masher until it is smooth to your liking.
4. Simmer and adjust spices until you're happy with the sauce.
5. Store in the fridge for up to 4 days, freeze for hell, I don't know, as long as you want?
