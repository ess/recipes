# Soft Pretzels #


## Ingredients ##

* 1.5c warm (100 to 115 F) water
* 1T sugar
* 2t kosher salt
* 1 package active dry yeast
* 22 oz all-purpose flour (about 4.5c)
* 2 oz unsalted butter
* Vegetable oil for pan
* 10c water
* 2/3c baking soda
* 1 large egg yolk beaten with 1T water
* Pretzel Salt


## Preparation ##

1. Combine warm water, sugar, and kosher salt in the bowl of a stand mixer and sprinkle the yeast on top. Allow to sit for 5 minutes or until the mixture begins to foam.
2. Add the flour and butter and, using the dough hook attachment, mix on low speed until well combined.
3. Change to medium speed and knead until the dough is smooth and pulls away from the side of the bowl, approximately 4 to 5 minutes.
4. Remove the dough from the bowl, clean the bowl, oil it with vegetable oil, return the dough to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and set in a warm place for approximately 50 to 55 minutes or until the dough doubles in size.
5. Preheat the oven to 450F, line 2 half sheet pans with parchment paper, lightly brush with vegetable oil, and set aside.
6. Bring the 10c of water and the baking soda to a rolling boil in an 8qt saucepan or roasting pan.
7. Turn the dough out onto a slightly oiled work surface, divide into 8 equal pieces. For each piece, roll it into a 24in rope, make a U shape with the rope, cross the legs over each other, then pinch it to the bottom of the U to make a pretzel shape. Place onto the parchment-lined half sheet pan.
8. Place the pretzels into the boiling water, one at a time, for 30s each. Return to the half sheet pan with a flat spatula, brush with eggwash and sprinkle with pretzel salt.
9. Bake for 12 to 14 minutes until dark golden brown in color. Transfer to a cooling rack for at least 5 minutes before serving.
