# Fudge #

## Ingredients ##

* 3/4 cup (1.5 sticks) butter
* 2.5 cups white granulated sugar
* 2/3 cup full-fat evaporated milk
* 1 12 oz package (high quality) semi-sweet chocolate chips, 2 cups
* 1 7 oz jar marshmallow fluff
* 1 tsp vanilla extract

## Setup ##

Fudge is a fickle beast. That being the case, we need to get our stuff set up and ready to go before we actually start.

1. Line an 8x8 or 9x9 inch square pan with parchment paper.
2. Open the chocholate chips.
3. Remove the lid and all traces of foil from the marshmallow fluff. We're going to microwave this later, so don't screw around.
4. Measure out the sugar.
5. Measure out the evaporated milk.
6. Measure out the butter.

## Preparation ##

1. In a 3qt heavy saucepan over medium heat, add the butter. Use a spoon to drage the melting butter up the sides of the pot, clear to the top, greasing the edges of the pan.
2. Once the butter is mostly melted, slowly pour the sugar into the center of the pan as carefully as you can, making sure to not get any sugar crystals on the side of the pan. With your wooden spoon, draw the butter in from the edges toward the center, going slowly all the way around the pan until it's mostly moistened. Do not leave any sugar crystals on the side of the pan or on the edge of your spoon, as it will make your fudge grainy. The goal is to dissolve all of the sugar.
3. Pour in the evaporated milk. Stir this mixture together thoroughly, making sure to douse any rogue bits of dry sugar with the liquid in the pan. All the dry sugar crystals need to be dissolved before the mixture reaches a boil.
4. Settle in for the boil. Bring the mixture to a full rolling boil (bubbles coming up from the center of the pot) over medium high heat. Stir *constantly* with a long wooden sppon. Once it starts boiling, set a timer for 5 minutes and turn the heat down to medium so that you don't burn your fingers off. It should be boiling the full 5 minutes. Stir constantly. A candy thermometer should read about 234-236 degrees F at the end. Take it off heat early if it reaches 234-236F before 5 minutes. Overcooking at this stage makes for dry, crumbly fudge.
5. Add the chocolate chips. When the timer goes off, remove from heat and add 12oz chocolate chips all at once. Stir vigorously until all the chocolate chips are melted and mixture is *completely* smooth. If there are lumps in the mixture, there will be lumps in your fudge. Get them all out.
6. Heat your 7oz tub of marshmallow fluff in the microwave for about 10-15s (to make it fast and easy to scoop out of the jar). Move quickly. Add all the marshmallow fluff to the chocolate mixture and beat with a wooden spoon until nearly blended.
7. Add 1tsp vanilla and continue stirring until there are no more marshmallow streaks and the mixture looks even and smooth. Stop stirring as soon as it's combined.
8. Immediately pour the mixture into the lined pan. Don't scrape the edges of the pot too well. Only pour fudge into the pan that is completely liquid and smooth. If the fudge bits on the edges of the pot look dried out at all, leave them behind. Shake the pan to help the fudge settle. Do not touch the top of the fudge or try to smooth it with a spatula. It should have a rippled appearance.
9. Let cool to room temp.
