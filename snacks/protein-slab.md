### Ingredients
**The Base (The "Brick" Structure)**
* **1/2 cup** Unflavored Micellar Casein (The "brick" foundation)
* **1/2 cup** Unflavored Whey Isolate (For the "doughy" chew)
* **2 tbsp** Coconut Flour (For dryness and structural density)
* **2 tbsp** Nutritional Yeast (For cheesy, savory depth)

**The Umami & Flavor**
* **2 tbsp** Mushroom Powder (Shiitake for earthiness, Porcini for beefiness)
* **1/2 tsp** Salt Substitute (Potassium Chloride)
* **1/2 tsp** Garlic Powder
* **1/2 tsp** Smoked Paprika (For a "charred" meat aroma)

**The Binders**
* **3 tbsp** Tahini or Sunflower Butter (Unsweetened/Low Sodium)
* **2-3 tbsp** Warm Water (To bloom the mushroom powder)
* **1 tsp** Apple Cider Vinegar (Optional: mimics the "tang" of aged meat)

### Instructions

1.  **Bloom the Umami:** In a small bowl, mix the **Mushroom Powder** and **Salt Substitute** into the **Warm Water**. Stir until it forms a thick slurry. Let it sit for 2 minutes.
2.  **Combine Dry Ingredients:** In a food processor (highly recommended for density) or a bowl, whisk together the **Casein**, **Whey**, **Coconut Flour**, **Nutritional Yeast**, and remaining spices.
3.  **Incorporate Fats:** Add the **Tahini** and the mushroom slurry to the dry mix.
4.  **Process to "Clay":** Pulse the food processor or stir vigorously with a stiff spatula. You are looking for a "heavy clay" consistency. If it is too crumbly to hold together, add water **one teaspoon at a time**. It should be difficult to mix.
5.  **Compress:** Line a small rectangular container with parchment paper. Transfer the dough and press it down with extreme force (use the bottom of a heavy glass) to eliminate air pockets.
6.  **Cure:** Place in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours. The Casein and Coconut flour will hydrate and "set" into a solid block.
7.  **Portion:** Slice into 4 bricks. Wrap individually in parchment or foil.

### Sensory & Health Tips
* **The "Gristle" Effect:** For rubbery "pops" of texture, fold in 1 tsp of **chia seeds** or small cubes of **unflavored beef gelatin** before pressing.
* **The "Rock" Method:** For maximum resistance, eat these directly from the **freezer**.
* **Blood Pressure Note:** Always consult your doctor before using potassium-based salt substitutes if you are on BP medication.
